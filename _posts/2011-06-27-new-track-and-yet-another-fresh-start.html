<p>OK, I'll admit it.  Starting this blog shortly before my exams truly was a piss-poor idea.  But now they're over, I'll try to stick to this properly.  I promise.  Really.</p>

<p>Anyway, now that that's out of the way, the exciting news is now that I'm back in London I'm able to start writing tracks seriously again; indeed, I have just released a new one, in reponse to the first track in <a href="http://www.soundcloud.com/colby-keating">DJ Caustic</a>'s <i>Mix Wars</i> series, <i>Dip Watch</i>.  My version is called <i>Dipshit</i>, and is available right <a href="http://soundcloud.com/loomcore/dipshit">here</a>, right now.  I expect this'll probably end up on <i>Wurk</i>, the release I'm working on at the moment, which is still very much a <i>Wurk</i>-in-progress, ho ho.  I apologise.  Tracks are available <a href="http://soundcloud.com/loomcore/sets/wurk/">here</a> as I finish them.  Expect a track sampling the dulcet tones of <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/BenAshenden">Bash</a> ranting about car dealerships next; it's going to be... spesh.</p>
